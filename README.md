# Movie Saga List
This application displays a list of movies from our database. Users have the ability to view the details of a movie which include a description of the movie as well as associated genres.

## Description
Duration: 3 days.

I had a couple problems with this project mainly getting it talking with the database, and making the details and title show up in the edit page. I solve this problem by console logging every time it had to talk to the datebase and checking everything carefully, solving the other problem had to do with how I was making the saga's talk to the database.
